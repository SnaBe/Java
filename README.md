## ReadMe for Java
I began taking Java lessons in school, some of projects and assignments will be uploaded to this folder.

All code here is written in Java (Hence the name) 
Most of the code is edited using Netbeans if anyone was wondering.

Quick description: Public java code from school lessons.

Current projects: 
Note: Not all projects are uploaded fully, some may miss some packages or other classes.

# Cylinder calculator (Using user input) 
This is our current school project, my plan is to turn it into a standalone program or web-application.


More projects will be uploaded and documented later, as we progress during the class.
In the beginning, most of the code will be commented in Danish, bear in mind that this is due to me better understanding the code.
I'll upload English translations near the end of the school year.
