# README for Java
I've begun taking Java lessons in school, I'll upload some of the projects and assignments here.

All code here is written in Java (Hence the name) 
Most of the code is edited using Netbeans if anyone was wondering.

Quick description: Public java code from school lessons.

## Current projects: 
Note: Not all projects are uploaded fully, some may miss some packages or other classes.

### Simple calculator (Using user input) 
This is my current free time project, it has nothing to do with any of my school projects, my plan is to turn it into a standalone program (JAR or EXE) or web-application. (Snabe.me/calculator fx.)

This project is finished and can be found under Projects/Lommeregner. 
The calculator is made using NetBeans UI system with JavaForm and some regular Java code. 

More projects will be uploaded and documented later, as we progress during the class.
In the beginning, most of the code will be commented in Danish, bear in mind that this is due to me better understanding the code.
I'll upload English translations near the end of the school year.
